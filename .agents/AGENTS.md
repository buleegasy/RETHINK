# Project-Scoped Rules: RE-THINK Agent

## 1. Build & Deployment Rules
- **Optimize build performance**: When deploying to platforms like Cloudflare Pages, run the build command directly (e.g. `vite build`) instead of chaining slow type-checking commands (like `tsc -b`) to prevent environment deployment timeouts.
- **Maintain pristine lockfiles**: Always clean and regenerate `package-lock.json` when adding packages that clash with existing lock conditions to guarantee deterministic dependencies and avoid deployment-time install hangs.
